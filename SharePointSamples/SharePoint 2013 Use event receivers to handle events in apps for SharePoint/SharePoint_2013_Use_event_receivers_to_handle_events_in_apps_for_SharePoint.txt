SharePoint 2013: Use event receivers to handle events in apps for SharePoint

Summary:  Learn how to handle events in an app for SharePoint by using the SharePoint development tools in Visual Studio 2012.


Description of the sample

This sample demonstrates the basics of how to use a remote event receiver to handle events that occur to list items in an app for SharePoint. This sample also shows how to use an app event receiver to handle events that occur to the app itself. This sample extends the sample SharePoint 2013: Perform basic data access operations by using CSOM in apps by adding a remote event receiver and an app event receiver to it. When you install the app, the app event handler handles the app installation and creates a log file in a folder in your \My Documents folder. When you add an item to a list, an entry is added to a log list in the app.


Prerequisites

This sample requires the following components:
•	A development environment that includes SharePoint 2013 Preview and that's configured for app isolation and OAuth
•	Visual Studio 2012 and SharePoint development tools in Visual Studio 2012
•	Basic familiarity with C# and the client object model for SharePoint
•	The sample SharePoint 2013: Perform basic data access operations by using CSOM in apps


Key components of the sample

The basic sample app for event handling contains the following components:
•	The BasicDataOperations project, which contains the AppManifest.xml file
•	The BasicDataOperationsWeb project, which contains the following files:
•	Home.aspx file, which contains the HTML and ASP.NET controls for the app’s user interface
•	Home.aspx.cs file, which contains the C# code that uses the client object model for SharePoint to read and write data
•	RemoteEventReceiver1.svc.cs, which contains the C# code that handles the events for list items in the app
•	AppEventReceiver.svc.cs, which contains the C# code that handles the events for the app for SharePoint
•	Web.config file


Configure the sample

To configure the sample app for basic data operations, update the SiteUrl property of the solution with the local URL of the SharePoint 2013 Preview site. You must develop remote event receivers and app event receivers on the local system. After you deploy them, they can be used on remote systems.


Build the sample

Choose the F5 key to build and deploy the app.


Run and test the sample
1.	Choose the F5 key to build and deploy the app.
2.	On the consent page, choose the Trust It link to grant permissions to the app.
3.	Use the app’s interface to create a list, and then add an item to the list on the parent SharePoint 2013 Preview site.
4.	View the EventLog list to verify that the remote event receiver handled the list item addition by adding an entry to the list.
5.	In your \My Documents folder, view the contents of the new folder that's named SPAppEventLog. This folder contains files that the app event receiver adds, and each file represents an app event that occurred.


Troubleshooting

The following lists common configuration and environment errors that prevent the sample from running or deploying correctly and how to solve them.

Visual Studio doesn't open the browser after you choose the F5 key.	
	Set the app for SharePoint project as the startup project.
HTTP error 405 Method not allowed.	
	Locate the applicationhost.config file in %userprofile%\Documents\IISExpress\config.
	Locate the handler entry for StaticFile, and add the verbs GET, HEAD, POST, DEBUG, and TRACE.
